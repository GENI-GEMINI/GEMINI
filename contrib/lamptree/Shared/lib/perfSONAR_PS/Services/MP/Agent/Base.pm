=head1 NAME

perfSONAR_PS::Services::MP::Agent::Base

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module that contains the basic methods involved in gathering data by some
means and parsing it's output. This module should be inherited to provide a
consistent interface to the gathering (collecting), parsing and storage of data
for different perfsonar MP services.

The purpose of this module is to create objects that contain all necessary 
information to make measurements and understand the output.

use perfSONAR_PS::Common;

use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);
our $logger = Log::Log4perl::get_logger( 'perfSONAR_PS::Services::MP::Agent::Base' );

=head2 new()

Creates a new agent class, all results should be stored under $self->{RESULTS} 
in some format that is understood internally by the class.
This should be overloaded by inheriting classes.

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $package ) = @_;
    my $self = {
        'RESULTS'  => {},
        'OPTIONS'  => {},
        'ERRORMSG' => undef,
        'TIMEOUT'  => 60,      # seconds timeout
    };

    bless( $self, $package );
    return $self;
}

=head2 error( $text )

accessor/mutator method for storage and or retrieval of errors in executation
all methods should call this method with a human readable string $text 
when things go wrong

=cut

sub error {
    my $self = shift;
    if ( @_ ) {
        $self->{ERRORMSG} = shift;
    }
    return $self->{ERRORMSG};
}

=head2 timeout

accessor/mutator for the timeout value of command line run's

=cut

sub timeout {
    my $self = shift;
    if ( @_ ) {
        $self->{'TIMEOUT'} = shift;
    }
    return $self->{'TIMEOUT'};
}

=head2 init()

Initiate any datastructures/connections etc prior to collecting any measurements

Return:

  -1 = something failed
   0 = initialisation was okay

Should be overloaded by inherited classes when needed.

=cut

sub init {
    my $self = shift;
    return 0;
}

=head2 collectMeasurements( )

Do something to enable the collection of the results. After running the command
we MUST always call the parse() function in order to format the output into
an understanable datastructure which can then be used later.

Return:

 -1 = something failed
  0 = command ran okay

This method should be inherited.  

=cut

sub collectMeasurements {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    $logger->logdie( "parse() is a virtual method, please override with inherited implementation." );

    # example flow; we gather the output from running some tool and then
    # we need to translate the output into some internal datastructure using
    # the parse() method.

    my $output = 'Output from some tool';
    $self->parse( $output );

    return 0;
}

=head2 parse( \@results, $time )

Parses the data in the array of string @results into internal hash of variable=value.
on success, returns 0, otherwise -1;

=cut

sub parse {
    my $self      = shift;
    my $cmdOutput = shift;

    my $time = shift;    # work out start time of time

    $logger->logdie( "parse() is a virtual method, please override with inherited implementation." );

    return -1;
}

=head2 destination( $string )

accessor/mutator method to set the destination to ping to

=cut

sub source {
    my $self = shift;
    my $src  = shift;

    if ( $src ) {
        $self->{'OPTIONS'}->{source} = $src;
    }

    return $self->{'OPTIONS'}->{source};
}

=head2 destinationIp( $string )

accessor/mutator method to set the destination ip to ping to

=cut

sub sourceIp {
    my $self = shift;
    my $src  = shift;

    if ( $src ) {
        $self->{'OPTIONS'}->{sourceIp} = $src;
    }

    return $self->{'OPTIONS'}->{sourceIp};
}

=head2 destination( $string )

accessor/mutator method to set the destination to ping to

=cut

sub destination {
    my $self = shift;
    my $dest = shift;

    if ( $dest ) {
        $self->{'OPTIONS'}->{destination} = $dest;
    }

    return $self->{'OPTIONS'}->{destination};
}

=head2 destinationIp( $string )

accessor/mutator method to set the destination ip to ping to

=cut

sub destinationIp {
    my $self = shift;
    my $dest = shift;

    if ( $dest ) {
        $self->{'OPTIONS'}->{destinationIp} = $dest;
    }

    return $self->{'OPTIONS'}->{destinationIp};
}

=head2 results(  )

Accessor/Mutator function for the result of the output in some internal datastructure.

=cut

sub results {
    my $self = shift;
    if ( @_ ) {
        $self->{'RESULTS'} = shift;
    }
    return $self->{'RESULTS'};
}

=head2 fromDOM( )

Accepts a DOM object and determines the relative paramters to create and use
for the test

=cut

sub fromDOM() {
    my $self = shift;
    my $dom  = shift;

    # check input
    $logger->logdie( "Input is not a dom object" )
        unless UNIVERSAL::can( $dom, 'isa' ) && $dom->isa( 'XML::LibXML::Document' );

    $logger->logdie( "fromDOM() is virtual and should be overridden" );

    return -1;
}

=head2 toDOM(  )

Returns the full nmwg message (metadata and data elements) for the results 
that have been collected. Output should be a XML::LibXML::Document object.

=cut

sub toDOM {
    my $self = shift;

    $logger->logdie( "resultsXML() is a virtual method, please override with inherited implementation." );

    return;
}

=head2 resultsSQL( $namespace )

Returns the relevant SQL insert or update statement for the results.

=cut

sub toSQL {
    my $self = shift;

    $logger->logdie( "resultsSQL() is a virtual method, please override with inherited implementation." );

    return;
}

=head2 resultsRRD( $namespace )

Returns the relevant RRD statement for the results.

=cut

sub toRRD {

    my $self = shift;

    $logger->logdie( "resultsRRD() is a virtual method, please override with inherited implementation." );

    return;
}

  # create a new agent
  my $agent = new perfSONAR_PS::Services::MP::Agent::Base();
  
  # do some setting up
  $agent->init();
  
  # perform the measurement collection
  if ( $agent->collectMeasurements() == 0 ) {
  	# we have successfully collected the measurements, we must now extract the
  	# results into a form which is useable
  	  	
  	# spit out something useful
  	use Data::Dumper;
  	print "Results in raw parsed: " . Dumper $agent->results() . "\n";
  	
  	# or as XML
  	print "Results XML: " . $agent->xml() . "\n";
  	
  } else {
    # all errors should be stored under $agent->error()
  	print STDERR "Could not collect measurements: " . $agent->error() . "\n";
