Setting up the DCN Topology Agent
---------------------------------

Setup a topology service:

 1. Install Berkeley Sleepycat XML Database
 2. Either CPAN install perfSONAR_PS::Services::MA::Topology or checkout http://anonsvn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/trunk and use it.
 3. Run psConfigureDaemon to create an endpoint for the Topology Service
 4. Start the daemon

Setup the agent:
 - Install the OSCARS Java client
  1. Install java
  2. Download the axis2 distribution from http://ws.apache.org/axis2 and the rampart module from http://ws.apache.org/axis2/modules/rampart/1_3/security-module.html
  3. Unzip the axis2 distribution and set the environmental variable AXIS2_HOME to point at the directory created
  4. Unzip the rampart distribution and run 'ant' in the rampart-1.3 directory.
    - This copies the rampart jars into the axis2 directory
  5. Move the axis2 distribution to a final destination and ensure that the variable AXIS2_HOME gets set on login
  6. Checkout http://anonsvn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/trunk
  7. The OSCARS client will be located in "scripts/OSCARS". It is a directory named "oscars_client". Either move it to a well-known location or remember where it is located.

 - Configure the agent
  1. There's an agent in the scripts directory (DCNTopologyAgent.pl)
  2. Create a file in the scripts directory named 'dcn_agent.conf'
    - The contents of that file should include the following:

     - domain:        This is the DCN domain (functions more to verify the data from the IDC). Should be es.net.
     - ls_uri:        The URI of the LS to register with. In our case, it is 'http://packrat.internet2.edu:8009/perfSONAR_PS/services/LS'
     - topology_uri:  The URI of the TS that you created above. Needs to be fully qualified so that other services can contact it.
     - idc_uri:       The URI of the OSCARS IDC. e.g. https://ndb3-blmt.abilene.ucaid.edu:8443/axis2/services/OSCARS
     - oscars_client: The path to the oscars client (e.g. /home/aaron/dcn/agents/oscars_client)
     - interval:      The pause time between agent runs. In each run, it will grab the topology from the IDC, update if needed and then lookup neighbors IDCs.
   3. Run the agent with the --verbose flag and you should see it grab the topology from the IDC, load it into the topology service and then contact the LS looking for more TSes.
