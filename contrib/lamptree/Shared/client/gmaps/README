SLAC gmaps perfSONAR-PS Mashup

Background

This package provides a google maps 'mash-up' for the presentation of 
perfsonar data. It can determine the geographical locations of a set of nodes and
display them on a google map. The package should be run as a CGI application
and enables flexible and extensible way to poll perfSONAR services using the
Template library and XPath.


Requirements

The suite is written in perl and requires the following CPAN modules:

Template - provides a framework for the separation of visualisation and business
logic. All nmwg xml messages are created using the Template module.

XML::SAX - Provides XML SAX parsers
XML::XPath - Provides a simple api to querying xml documents.
XML::LibXML::XPathContext - Provides XPATH

DBD::SQLite - sqlite interface

perfSONAR-PS - provides some base libraries to facilitate communication with
perfSONAR services.

CGI::Application - provides framework for cgi applications.
 
Please refer CPAN for installation of the above required modules.



Installation

cgi/gmaps.pl should be copied to /var/www/cgi (or whether your apache
configuraiton allows cgi scripts to be invoked).

The script html/gmaps.cgi should be edited and configured to point to the paths
of the relevant libraries and directories need for gmaps to function:

  # base directory for distribution's libraries
  use lib '/afs/slac.stanford.edu/u/sf/ytl/Work/perfSONAR/gmaps/trunk/lib';

  # base directory for perfsonar-ps libraries
  use lib '/afs/slac.stanford.edu/u/sf/ytl/Work/perfSONAR/perfSONAR-PS/trunk/perfSONAR-PS/lib';

  # set the path to the template directory from the main distribution
  my $baseTemplatePath = '/afs/slac.stanford.edu/u/sf/ytl/Work/perfSONAR/gmaps/trunk/lib/gmaps/templates/';

Ensure that your apache/web server has permissions to read the lib directory.

The use of Google Maps requires that each instance of gmaps requires it's url to be registered with Google.
For example, if the following message appears when you try to load gmaps:

  The Google Maps API key used on this web site was registered for a different web site. 
  You can generate a new key for this web site at http://code.google.com/apis/maps/.

Then please visit the above link and apply the Google Maps Key to html/gmaps.cgi



Usage

Point a web browser at the cgi script that was just installed. You can either
insert some ip address for known interfaces (from either a traceroute or from
known addresses) into the text box; OR you can select a domain to gather router
information from.

When the map comes up, you can scroll around by dragging on the map. To get
information from a particular router, either click on the relevant marker on the
map, or select it from the side bar list on the right.

The popup box will display the utilisation of the node from the last 24h.
Clicking on the 'info' tab will display information regarding the meta data 
of the node.

That's it.
