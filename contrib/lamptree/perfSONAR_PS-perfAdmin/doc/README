--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About:
------

The perfSONAR-PS perfAdmin package contains a series of web-based GUIs that
interact with perfSONAR Information and Data-oriented services.  The goal of
this package is to make these GUIs available for public use and modification.

perfAdmin relies on an external script to contact the perfSONAR IS
infrastructure.  This optimization prevents the CGI scripts from directly
initiating an active query and flooding the IS with duplicate requests for
information.  The results of this script, which is run through cron a regular
schedule, are then consumed by the GUIs to display a snapshot of the
infrastructure.

perfAdmin has the ability to display 4 different types of measurement data:

 - SNMP Utilization (from perfSONAR-PS SNMP MA and perfSONAR-MDM RRD MA)
 - Throughput (from perfSONAR-PS perfSONAR-BUOY)
 - One Way Latency (from perfSONAR-PS perfSONAR-BUOY)
 - Two Way Latency (from perfSONAR-PS PingER)

Extending perfAdmin to fit the needs of a particular deployment is possible and
expected - all CGI scripts and the caching program are open source and included
in the package.  The perfSONAR-PS team encourages suggestions and questions
regarding this product.  For more information please join the mailing list:

Installation:
-------------

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions
  
Configuration:
--------------

Additional configuration of this software is not required.  

Starting/Stopping:
------------------

perfAdmin has two "moving parts" that are controlled by external software:

1) Apache httpd controls access to the CGI scripts

2) cron controls execution of 'cache.pl', the script that queries the perfSONAR
   IS infrastructure

If you wish to prevent or restrict access to perfAdmin after installation it is
necessary to modify the apache/cron configurations:

1) '/etc/httpd/conf.d/perfAdmin.conf' contains the directive that exposes
   perfAdmin through Apache httpd

2)  '/etc/cron.d/perfAdmin.cron' contains the entry that cron will execute
    regarding the 'cache.pl' script.

Testing:
--------

After installation visit:

    http://YOURHOST/perfAdmin

The directory should be viewable (N.B. to alter this disable 'Indexes' in the
'Options' line of '/etc/httpd/conf.d/perfAdmin.conf').  The following are
'entry' pages that can be used for testing:

    1) http://YOURHOST/perfAdmin/directory.cgi - View of active services
       separated by type.  Note that only certain types are supported, so if
       you are looking for a specific service please check to be sure it is of a
       supported type.  
    
    2) http://YOURHOST/perfAdmin/tree.cgi - View of all active gLSs and hLSs that
       are registered into the perfSONAR-IS

Note that on first viewing you may not see any data for either of these CGIs,
this is normal.  The 'cache.pl' program will run every 30 minutes via cron, the
data will be available 30 minutes after installation.
