             perfSONAR SNMP MA Service Installation Instructions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The perfSONAR-PS SNMP Measurement Archive (MA) offers archived SNMP data stored
in Round Robin Database (RRD) files through a web services interface.  RRD
storage is normally used in tools such as MRTG, Cacti, and Cricket - interfaces
are provided for directly interacting with these tools or specifying the
information stored in RRD files of other types.

Prerequisites:
--------------

The SNMP MA is packaged as an RPM - an installation format geared towards use
on Red Hat Linux based systems.  Examples include Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, CentOS, White Box, Scientific Linux, and possibly others.  

These Linux distributions normally rely on "Package Management" tools to install
and maintain software.  Examples of these tools include up2date, YUM, and
APT-RPM.  Internet2 has created a repository to house the perfSONAR-PS software,
related performance tools, and hard to find prerequisites.  We encourage
adopters of these performance tools to install a simple RPM package that gives
the necessary configuration information for the YUM and APT-RPM tools.  The RPM
can be found here:

  wget -c http://software.internet2.edu/Internet2-repo-0.1-2.noarch.rpm
  
To install this RPM first import the signing key:

  (sudo) rpm --import http://software.internet2.edu/rpms/RPM-GPG-KEY-Internet2

Then install the RPM:

  (sudo) rpm -ivh Internet2-repo-0.1-2.noarch.rpm

It is also recommended that an additional repository be installed for hard to 
find prerequisite software that may not be available in traditional repositories
used by the Linux distributions.  Two regarded repositories are:

 * http://dries.ulyssis.org/rpm/
 * http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/
 
Each site provides configuration instructions and packages similar to the
Internet2 repository.

If using a package management system is not an option, or if your system is not
RedHat based (e.g. Debian, Gentoo, etc.) it is still possible to install this
software and related requirements by hand.  Please see the "Installation (Tar
Package)" and "Installation (SVN)" sections for more details.  This tool uses
the following Perl libraries, libraries, and external tools to function:

  * Perl Libraries
    - Config::General
    - Cwd
    - DBI
    - DBD::mysql
    - Data::UUID
    - Date::Manip
    - Digest::MD5
    - Error
    - Exporter
    - File::Basename
    - File::Temp
    - Getopt::Long
    - HTTP::Daemon
    - IO::File
    - LWP::Simple
    - LWP::UserAgent
    - Log::Log4perl
    - Log::Dispatch
    - Log::Dispatch::FileRotate
    - Log::Dispatch::Screen
    - Module::Load
    - Net::Ping
    - Params::Validate
    - RRDp
    - Socket
    - Sys::Hostname
    - Term::ReadKey
    - Time::HiRes
    - XML::LibXML
  * Libraries
    - LibXML2
  * Tools
    - RRDTool



Installation (YUM):
-------------------

Installation using YUM lets the package manager do the work of finding and
installing the dependencies.  The following command is all that is needed:

  (sudo) yum install perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA

There may be several prerequisites to install depending on the age of your
system.  To ensure that all are found, please be sure to install one of the
alternative repositories above. 



Installation (APT-RPM):
-----------------------

Like YUM, installation with APT-RPM also manages the task of finding
dependencies.  The following commands will install is needed:

  (sudo) apt-get update
  (sudo) apt-get install perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA

There may be several prerequisites to install depending on the age of your
system.  To ensure that all are found, please be sure to install one of the
alternative repositories above.  



Installation (Bare RPM):
------------------------

If you do not wish to install the Internet2 Repository package, you may simply
find the appropriate RPM for your architecture without using a package manger.
For example if you are on an "i386" architecture:

  wget -c http://software.internet2.edu/rpms/i386/main/RPMS/perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-11.pSPS.noarch.rpm
  
To install without package manager help:

  (sudo) rpm -ivh perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-11.pSPS.noarch.rpm
  
Note that this RPM may need other packages to install correctly: if these
packages are not found on your system, you will need to manually download and
install them before proceeding.  An alternate method is to still use a package
manager in a "local" way (YUM only):

  (sudo) yum localinstall perl-perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1-11.pSPS.noarch.rpm
  
This will search the available repositories for any necessary packages.



Installation (Tar Package):
---------------------------

All RPM packages are also available in "source" packages that may be installed
and used in the typical Unix/Linux fashion.  There are helper scripts included
that may be used to download the necessary prerequisite software packages:

  wget -c http://software.internet2.edu/sources/perfSONAR-PS/perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1.11.tar.gz
  tar -zxfv perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1.11.tar.gz
  cd perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA-3.1.11
  (sudo) make install
    *Edit all configuration files - See README*
  cd scripts
  ./install_dependencies.sh
  ./prepare_environment.sh

The last three steps need to be run as root or via sudo. The latter two steps
will configure the machine's users and startup scripts as well as contact CPAN
for any necessary perl libraries.

In addition to perl requirements, there are other software requirements that
should be installed.  These are not controlled via the dependency scripts due to
differences in package management.  The tools are listed below:

  * RRDTool
    - Source is available here: http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/
    - Package management names:
      * Debian/Ubuntu: rrdtool, librrd2, librrd2-dev, librrds-perl, librrdp-perl
      * RedHat Systems: rrdtool, rrdtool-devel, perl-rrdtool
  * LibXML2
    - Package management names:
      * Debian/Ubuntu: libxml2, libxml2-dev, libxml2-utils
      * RedHat Systems: libxml2, libxml2-devel


Installation (SVN):
-------------------

Software may be downloaded directly from our anonymous subversion server.  This
installation method allows for easy upgrades between versions and access to 
bugfixes immediately.  There are two ways to download from our server, one that
retrieves all software and another that retrieves only selective services.

To download the entire release:

  svn checkout http://anonsvn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/tags/RELEASE_3.1 perfSONAR-PS
  
The instructions are the same here as for the Tar package.  Note that
installation may require pre-requisite software.  Read the preceding sections
for necessary items and suggestions on how to install and configure them.  When
you wish to update the checkout (to retrieve new development or bugfixes):

  cd perfSONAR-PS
  svn update
  
If a single service is all that is required, a similar method is used but also
note that the service must have access to a "Shared" directory that contains
perfSONAR-PS libraries:

  svn checkout http://anonsvn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/tags/RELEASE_3.1/perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA/
  svn checkout http://anonsvn.internet2.edu/svn/perfSONAR-PS/tags/RELEASE_3.1/Shared

The instructions are also the same as above:

  cd Shared
  svn update

and

  cd perfSONAR_PS-SNMPMA
  svn update
