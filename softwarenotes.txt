USER NODE:

Definitely need:
  psconfig - basic requirement for configuring itself from unis
  LSRegistrationDaemon

Node services needed sometimes:
  Pinger
  BWCTL
  OWAMP
  SNMPMA
  perfSONARBUOY
  Ganglia Monitoring Daemon (Host Monitoring)
  gmond
  PingerMA and Regular Tester
  NTP



ON THE MC:
  Toolkit
  Perfadmin
  UNIS (?) Right now it runs persistently outside the slice
  Host Monitoring Collector (Ganglia Meta Daemon)
  Ganglia MA
  Portal
  NTP
  Periscope
  gmond (perhaps)
  service watcher and psconfig (probably don't need but no harm in having)
